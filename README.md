# Bank-Tele-Marketing-Prediction
This system predicts whether or not a client will subscribe a term deposit. If the model has high accuracy, the banks can focus only on the potential customers “picked” by the classifier, improving their efficiency and managing their resources better. In this process we will find out which factors influence a customers’ decision, so that a more efficient and precise campaign strategy can be thought of to reduce costs and increase profits.

This ML project based on 2014 study “A data driven approach to predict the success of bank telemarketing” which  used data mining to predict the success of a telemarketing call for term deposits. The data includes the effect of financial crisis, analyzed large set of feature related to bank client, social and economic characteristics and product on a Portuguese-Based Telemarketing Campaign.
